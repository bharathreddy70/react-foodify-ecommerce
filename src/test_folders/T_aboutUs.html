  <h1>My Five Paragraphs</h1>

  <h2>Paragraph 1: Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Writing is one of the most powerful ways to share ideas and knowledge.  
    An introduction gives the reader a clear picture of what the text is about.  
    It creates curiosity and encourages the reader to continue exploring the content.  
    Without an introduction, the rest of the writing may seem incomplete or confusing.  
  </p>

  <h2>Paragraph 2: Background</h2>
  <p>
    Background information helps the reader understand the context of the topic.  
    It connects the main idea with real-world situations or past events.  
    By providing background, the writer ensures that the audience does not feel lost.  
    This section builds a strong foundation for what will follow in the discussion.  
  </p>

  <h2>Paragraph 3: Main Point</h2>
  <p>
    The main point is the heart of the entire content and deserves the most attention.  
    It usually introduces the core idea that the writer wants to explain or prove.  
    A strong main point is clear, focused, and supported by logical reasoning.  
    Without this, the writing may appear scattered or lacking purpose.  
  </p>

  <h2>Paragraph 4: Supporting Details</h2>
  <p>
    Supporting details are essential because they give strength to the main idea.  
    Examples, facts, and real-life situations help the reader believe in the point being made.  
    They also make the writing more engaging and easier to understand.  
    A paragraph with supporting details feels complete and trustworthy.  
  </p>

  <h2>Paragraph 5: Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    The conclusion ties together everything discussed in the previous sections.  
    It reminds the reader of the key points and highlights their importance.  
    A good conclusion may also suggest what to think or do next.  
    Ending strongly ensures that the writing leaves a lasting impression on the reader.
